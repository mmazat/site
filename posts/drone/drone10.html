    <h1>10 Inch Long Range Drone</h1>
    <p><em>January 01, 2025</em></p>
    <br></br>
    <p>I initially built a 10-inch long-range drone, inspired by this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myyC8T7Jbsw&amp;t=141s">YouTube video</a>. In the United States, drones weighing over 250 grams must be registered with the FAA and equipped with a remote ID tracker, which I ensured to do. Additionally, you need to install the FAA-recommended app and obtain permission through a LAANC service. Although this drone is impressive in size and capable of long-range flights, I soon realized that starting with such a large drone was not ideal for a beginner. Consequently, I built a 3.5-inch drone, which is more suitable for indoor use and easier to handle. I plan to share more details about this drone as I gain more experience and find better flying locations.</p>
