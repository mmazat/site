    <h1>DIY Drone Journey</h1>
    <p><em>January 01, 2025</em></p>
    <br></br>
    <p>In 2024, I decided to purchase a drone. However, I returned it after just a few days as it quickly became boring. This led me to the decision to build my own drone, allowing me to continuously develop it with sensors, algorithms, and other modifications. Here are some reasons why building a drone is preferable to buying one:</p>
<ul>
<li>It is significantly cheaper, allowing you to allocate more funds towards additional gadgets.</li>
<li>Drones are prone to crashes, and being able to repair them yourself is crucial if you are serious about the hobby. Commercial drones, like those from DJI, can be costly to repair and often require dealing with customer service.</li>
<li>Purchasing a drone locks you into the manufacturer's ecosystem for development. I prefer the flexibility and freedom of the open-source world.</li>
</ul>
<p>There are three popular platforms for building drones: ArduPilot, INAV, and Betaflight. ArduPilot is the most complex and versatile, while Betaflight is the easiest to use. I currently prefer INAV as it offers similar features to Betaflight along with the autonomy features I enjoy. Here are some of the best YouTubers who provide comprehensive guides on these platforms:</p>
<ul>
<li>Joshua Bardwell: Extensive videos on Betaflight.</li>
<li>Painless360: Excellent videos on INav.</li>
</ul>
