    <h1>Zebra Retail Store and Warehouse Autonomous Robots</h1>
    <p><em>April 05, 2025</em></p>
    <br></br>
    <p>In 2018, I joined Zebra Technologies to develop autonomous robots for major retail stores and warehouses. The robot, later named <a href="https://connect.zebra.com/smartsight" target="_blank">Zebra Smart Sight</a>, was designed to autonomously scan store shelves, collect inventory data, and report any necessary actions required to store management.</p>
<p>I developed the visual SLAM initially and then led a team to elevate it to a tightly coupled visual, lidar, and odometry SLAM. Later on, I joined the CV/AI team to work on object detection. This project was the most complex I have ever done: architecture and development of a tightly coupled multi-sensor SLAM solution.</p>
<p>Here is an image of the Zebra Smart Sight:</p>

<p>I spent many nights testing this robot in retail stores, as daytime testing would interfere with normal store operations. Below is a picture of me diagnosing a robot at 3 AM:</p>
