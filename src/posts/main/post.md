Hello!

My name is Mehdi Mazaheri, and this is my personal website. I am a software, robotics, and geomatics engineer, currently living and working in San Francisco Bay Area. You can find me on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mmazaheri/).

I do many DIY projects for fun as well. I will share them here.
