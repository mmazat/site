I initially built a 10-inch long-range drone, inspired by this [Youtube Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=myyC8T7Jbsw). In the United States, drones weighing over 250 grams must be registered with the FAA and equipped with a remote ID tracker, which I ensured to do. Additionally, you need to install the FAA-recommended app and obtain permission through a LAANC service. Although this drone is impressive in size and capable of long-range flights, I soon realized that starting with such a large drone was not ideal for a beginner. Therefore, I built a 3.5-inch drone, which is more suitable for indoor use and easier to handle. I plan to share more details about this drone as I gain more experience and find better flying locations.

The 10-inch drone:

Drone crashes a lot, and if you build one, it is easier to repair. As you see I badly crashed this, and it only cost me 20$ to fix, by ordering a new frame, and replacing the arm. I have now 3 more spare arms.
