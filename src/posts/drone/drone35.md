I built a 3.5-inch drone following [this video](https://youtu.be/aXrrg48auhU?si=Ta766uZoYvSO6QAG). Using the INav configurator, I flashed the firmware and installed an optical flow and range sensor (Matek 3901) with guidance from [this video](https://youtu.be/T1CkdG9gaYk?si=r26BCVvGVcIB0keX). These sensors help stabilize the drone's position and altitude. I disabled the GPS and magnetometer in INav and did a lot of PID tuning to achieve stable position mode. Ability to hold altitude and position is very helpful for a beginner pilot.

Here is an image of the 3.5-inch drone:
